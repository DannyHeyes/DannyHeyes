- 👋 Hi, I’m Danny 
- 👀 I’m interested in continuously developing my programming skills, and bringing beautiful designs to life. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate React.js and how I can use it more efficiently to make my code more simple, all the while creating larger projects. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects that include React.js as well as Gatsby.js. I also would like to collaborate on projects that use APIs and would love to learn more about building my own.
- 📫 How to reach me - you can send me a DM on twitter (@dannyheyes) or on instagram (also @dannyheyes), or just send me a good old email: hello@dannyheyes.com
